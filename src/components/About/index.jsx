               <p> <h1 className="about-me">Hello my name is Milana and I am Fullstack Developer focusing on PERN stack. 
After having explored and worked in the world of psychology as a social worker, I decided to take on a more analytical position. I first started out on Code Academy, then decided to completely immerse myself in learning code by enrolling in Fullstack Academy's intensive bootcamp. 
I've found that I truly enjoy the problem-solving aspect of coding. Seeing applications come to life in the process of software development always amazes me how you can create something out of nothing. 
Up next I am excited to join a team where I can contribute to building out life-changing applications, and also continue to push my knowledge of code to the next level.
