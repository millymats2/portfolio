                <p>My name is Milana and I am Fullstack Developer focusing on PERN stack. 
After having explored and worked in the world of psychology as a social worker, I decided to take on a more analytical position. I first started out on Code Academy, then decided to completely immerse myself in learning code by enrolling in Fullstack Academy's intensive bootcamp.</p> 
I've found that I truly enjoy the problem-solving aspect of coding. Seeing applications come to life in the process of software development always amazes me how you can create something out of nothing. <p>On days I am not glued to my computer typing away, I enjoy a large multitude of hobbies. I am a baker, gym enthusiast, hiker, snowboarder, reader, and artist. I believe that as a developer it is incredibly important to enjoy a wide variety of hobbies as they inspire creativity and passion, which then transfers into one's code. </p>
Up next I am excited to join a team where I can contribute to building out life-changing applications, and also continue to push my knowledge of code to the next level.
